    - Found asset for light saber
        - This was a free asset created by Oleksandr Zymohliad
        - Made changes for the light saber to fix texturing
    
    - Added the Training scene
        - Added the terrain to the scene
	- Created a placeholder for the training droid and wrote the laser firing script
	- Created a laser prefab with a sphere and particle effect
	- Added in the lightsabers to replace the controllers
	- Caused an issue where this was all added to the wrong scene and need to swap the objects over
	- Took a while to get the training droid to move around the player in a hemisphere
		- Still need to fix an issue with the training droid where the laser blasts are from other areas than the 
		current location of the training droid. I think this has to do with the delay inherit in initialization.
