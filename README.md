		- Created a placeholder for the training droid and wrote the laser firing script

		- Caused an issue where this was all added to the wrong scene and need to swap the objects over
		- Took a while to get the training droid to move around the player in a hemisphere
			- Still need to fix an issue with the training droid where the laser blasts are from other areas than the 
			current location of the training droid. I think this has to do with the delay inherit in initialization.
